I am a marine biologist, microbial ecologist, *part-time* bioinformatician, post doc researcher, diver, *wannabe* writer, *former* musician (pianist/keyboardist).  

Currently, I am working at the [George Washington University](https://biology.columbian.gwu.edu/christina-pavloudi) at the [Saw Microbial Diversity Lab](https://sawlab.org/).

Previously, I was working at the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture ([IMBBC](https://imbbc.hcmr.gr/user/cpavloud/)) of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR). 

I have studied Biology (BSc) at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.bio.auth.gr/en), Environmental Biology – Management of Terrestrial and Marine Resources (MSc) at the [University of Crete](http://envbio.biology.uoc.gr/) and Marine Sciences (PhD) at the [Ghent University](https://www.marinebiology.ugent.be/) and the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/microecophys). If you are wondering how the later was possible, it was a joint PhD degree organized under the framework of the [MARES Joint Doctoral Programme on Marine Ecosystem Health & Conservation](http://econsortprd.ugent.be/index.asp?p=1840&a=1840).

You can find me in, almost, all the relevant platforms that scientists use to interact with each other (and keep their *scores*).
