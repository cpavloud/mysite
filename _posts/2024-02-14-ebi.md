So last Vanentine's day, I got to give a webinar on **Investigating microbial ecology in extreme habitats**!

This webinar is part of a webinar series on **Exploring microbial ecosystems** that highlights contemporary concepts, methodologies, and valuable resources for examining microbial ecosystems and their influence on the environment and human health. 

If you missed the live webinar, you can always go through the [slides](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/training/2024/Webinars/Microbial-ecosystems_CPavloudi.pdf) of the presentation and/or you can also watch the webinar's recording:
