What more can a person ask?

I have just returned from my trip to the [Biosphere2](https://biosphere2.org/) facility for an [IODP](https://www.iodp.org/) workshop on Scientific Ocean Drilling in the Gulf of Papua!!

This [workshop](https://usoceandiscovery.org/workshop-gulf-of-papua/) aimed to promote research opportunities in the Gulf of Papua (GoP), which to date, has not been explored by scientific ocean drilling programs. The Gulf of Papua is uniquely situated to address  key questions related to the evolution of Cenozoic climate. Located off the southeastern margin of Papua New Guinea (PNG), and within the rainy tropical region of the Indo Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), the GoP receives unusually high volumes of siliciclastic sediments eroding from PNG, as well as large contributions of calcareous sediment transported from the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and PNG Barrier Reef, and offshore atolls (e.g., Ashmore and Eastern Fields).

A special shout-out to the "Coral Reef Group): [Andr√© Droxler](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/andre-w-droxler), [Mohammed Hashim](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/mohammedhashim/), [Brandon Harper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonbharper/), [Laura Buehrig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurabuehrig), [Benjamin Petrick](https://www.palaeontologie.ifg.uni-kiel.de/en/team/dr-benjamin-petrick).

Let's get this proposal funded!!
