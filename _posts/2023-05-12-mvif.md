I am so glad to have become a member of the Atlantic committee of the Microbiome Virtual International Forum ([MVIF](https://www.microbiome-vif.org/en-US/-/info/about-us))!

The aim of the Microbiome Virtual International Forum (MVIF) is to provide a more convenient, accessible, monthly 3-hour alternative to traditional annual multi-day conferences to disseminate high-quality microbiome research in a free and open-access setting, and facilitate scientific networking and collaborations in a globally accessible online format that  promotes diversity of organizers, presenters, and participants. The dissemination activities are meant to be primarily by scientists and for scientists and with rigorous scientific and evidence-based standards. MVIF is committed to including and promoting diversity of gender, race/ethnicity, and geography, and actively engages and promotes students and early-career researchers and scientists.

If you want to present your research, you can [submit your abstract](https://www.microbiome-vif.org/en-US/-/info/how-to-submit-an-abstract) anytime. 

And if you want to hear more about the upcoming talks, you can [subscribe to the newsletter](https://stats.sender.net/forms/aQOGld/view).
