## Introduction

Coastal lagoons are highly dynamic and extremely unpredictable aquatic systems due to the fluctuation of their environmental variables (Barnes, 1980), while being particularly vulnerable to human activities (Guelorget and Perthuisot, 1992; Benlloch et al., 1995). This is due to confinement, i.e. the time of renewal of the elements of marine origin at any given point (Guelorget and Perthuisot, 1983), and their shallow depth (Bellan, 1972; Guelorget and Perthuisot, 1992). In addition, coastal lagoons are ecosystems of great economic value, because of their high productivity (Knoppers, 1994) which leads to their intensive exploitation through aquaculture and fisheries activities (PÃ©rez-Ruzafa and Marcos, 2012). Furthermore, human induced eutrophication can occur in coastal lagoons due to the excessive use of fertilizers for agricultural purposes in their watersheds and drainage basins (Cloern, 2001).
Apart from human interference, lagoons are also susceptible to changes induced by natural events, such as storms and river flooding (Avramidis et al., 2013). The structure and function of lagoonal ecosystems is largely affected by the input of organic matter from land, the marine environment and the atmosphere (Reizopoulou et al., 1996; Arvanitidis et al., 1999; Viaroli et al., 2008; Tagliapietra et al., 2009) and its subsequent decomposition and removal (Tagliapietra et al., 2012).
Lagoons may suffer dystrophic crises due to the accumulation of excessive concentrations of organic matter and subsequent increase in microbial heterotrophic activities, leading to consumption of the dissolved oxygen (Guelorget and Perthuisot, 1992; Avramidis et al., 2013). Hypoxia, or even anoxia in certain cases, induced by the increased rate of microbial respiration, leads to sulfate reduction and subsequent accumulation of hydrogen sulfide (Danovaro and Pusceddu, 2007).
Microbial communities in lagoonal environments are different compared to freshwater and marine environments (Ghai et al., 2012); although they are located in an intermediate salinity regime with pronounced temporal variations which poses a significant stress in biota, which is added to the stress induced by hypoxia, coastal lagoons exhibit high microbial diversity (Danovaro and Pusceddu, 2007). Apart from salinity, nutrient availability (Segnini de B et al., 2015) and level of eutrophication (de Wit, 2008) seem to influence microbial activity in lagoonal sediments.

### The lagoonal complex of Amvrakikos Gulf

Amvrakikos Gulf is a semi-enclosed embayment located in the northwestern part of Greece (Ionian Sea, Western Greece). It is about 35 km long and 15 km wide with a maximum depth of 65 m (Ferentinos et al., 2010), and it is one of the largest semi-enclosed gulfs in the Mediterranean Sea. The wetlands of Amvrakikos Gulf, i.e. lagoons, reed-beds and marshes (Avramidis et al., 2013), are protected by the international Ramsar convention and included in the Natura 2000 network (Vasileiadou et al., 2016). The Gulf is connected with the Ionian Sea via a narrow channel, the Preveza (Aktio) Strait, of minimum 600 m width, 3 km length and 8.5 m depth (Kapsimalis et al., 2005). Recent sedimentation patterns in the Gulf are related to the terrigenous inputs primarily from the Arachthos River, located in the northeast of the Gulf, and secondarily from the Louros River, located in the northwest (Poulos et al., 1993, 1995; Kapsimalis et al., 2005).
Oxygen depletion events are not unusual for Amvrakikos Gulf, as hypoxic and anoxic conditions have been recorded since the Holocene both due to natural geologic processes (Ferentinos et al., 2010), as well as due to human activities (Avramidis et al., 2013). In addition, H2S and CH4 gas charged sediments and eutrophication have been recorded in the Gulf (Papatheodorou et al., 1993; Ferentinos et al., 2010; Kountoura and Zacharias, 2011). About 20% of the total area of the Gulf is characterized by dysoxic conditions, while about 30% is characterised by anoxic conditions (Ferentinos et al., 2010).
