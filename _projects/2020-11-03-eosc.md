## Background

Genomic Observatories (GOs) are sites subjected to long-term scientific research, including the study of genomic
biodiversity, from single-celled microbes to multicellular organisms. 
GOs, under the European Marine Omics
Biodiversity Observation Network ([EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon)), a European Marine Biological Resource Centre ([EMBRC](https://www.embrc.eu/)) initiative, will be providing regular monthly (or bimonthly) sampling along with metagenomics data of microbial communities from marine sites throughout Europe. 
However, the success of GOs and of similar effots lies in the prompt supply of the marine biological community with FAIR data but also with preliminary results from their analysis.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Hori-
zon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agree-
ment No 824087


Our contribution focuses on building an effective workflow for the analysis of the metagenomic GO data in a time-effective and
reproducible way. Methods: Based on the well established MGnify resource, we developed a workflow to address these challenges
combining the Common Workflow Language notion with the Research Object Crate concept. Findings: metaGOflow supports the
fast inference of the taxonomic profiles of the GO-derived data based on rRNA genes and their functional annotation using its raw
reads. A JSON-LD file is also returned, including all the relative metadata about both the sample and its bioinformatic analysis, thus
maximizing the data provenance. metaGOflow can be used in any High Performance Computing (HPC) system and soon will be
available for cloud performance. Conclusions: metaGOflow is a robust workflow that scales up to the needs of projects such as GOs.
It highlights how containerization technologies along with modern workflow languages and metadata package approaches can
support the needs of the exponential growth of data produced, but also how already established workflows written this way, can be
of great use to address the challenges of more specific tasks.




**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.
