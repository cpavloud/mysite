## What is this project about?

Genomic Observatories (GOs) are sites subjected to long-term scientific research, including the study of genomic
biodiversity, from single-celled microbes to multicellular organisms. 
GOs, under the European Marine Omics
Biodiversity Observation Network ([EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon)), a European Marine Biological Resource Centre ([EMBRC](https://www.embrc.eu/)) initiative, will be providing regular monthly (or bimonthly) sampling along with metagenomics data of microbial communities from marine sites throughout Europe. 
However, the success of GOs and of similar effots lies in the prompt supply of the marine biological community with FAIR data but also with preliminary results from their analysis.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 824087, [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) and more specifically, under the [Digital Life Sciences Open Call](https://www.eosc-life.eu/opencall/).

The overall focus of the project is to build an effective workflow for the analysis of the metagenomic GO data in a time-effective and reproducible way. Based on the well established [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) resource, we developed a workflow to address these challenges
combining the Common Workflow Language ([CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)) notion with the Research Object Crate ([RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/))concept. 

metaGOflow supports the fast inference of the taxonomic profiles of the GO-derived data based on rRNA genes and their functional annotation using its raw reads.

metaGOflow was developed as a joint project by ELIXIR (EMBL-
EBI) and seven national nodes of the European Marine Biological Resource Centre (EMBRC) ( BE, UK, FR, GR, IT, PT, ES) with the ultimate mission to build a distributed workflow for analyses of marine metagenomic data generated by EMBRC’s GOs.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.
